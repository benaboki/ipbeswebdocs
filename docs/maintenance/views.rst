Check views
-----------
An archive of views used on the IPBES website is made available here: https://github.com/ipbes/ipbeswebdocs/tree/master/docs/views

- Cache views: Turn on caching for blocks and pages created using the Views module. This allows you to cache the output of the query used to generate the view, or the end HTML output of your View, and you can tune the cache for them separately
- Simplify view design
- Regularly check views for breakages especially after uninstalling modules
